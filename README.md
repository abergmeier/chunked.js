stream.js
=========

Polyfill for [Streams API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/streams-api/raw-file/tip/Overview.htm#stream-interface).

Near goal is to have `ArrayBuffer` support. `readAsText` is no immediate goal.

###WONTFIX:
* Will for now not implement `StreamBuilder` since it is expected to be merged into `Stream`.
